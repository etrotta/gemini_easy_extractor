Japanese Light Novel being used for testing

The other two examples were created by LLMs


The outputs are not perfect. For example:
- the João e Maria output did not include Maria as a Character
- the roleplay output hallucinates a location (Study)
- the Japanese output has different languages for different tags, and the "location" "モフミミキングダム" is a joke objective, yet the model says as if they met there

If I ran it multiple times and cherry-picked the best results for each category, I could get results good enough to pass for human quality, but
these results are intentionally realistic to show that despite it working to some extent, you should not rely on it.

Also remember: The output may change every time you run it, even with the exact same inputs, configurations etc.
